Hey ,
My name is AMAN SHARMA.


Computer Science final year B.Tech student at AKTU.
Always keen to learn and explore new technologies.

Check my Portfolio on https://www.amannvl.me

Some of my projects are -

[Twitter Clone](https://www.twitter.amannvl.me) using Bootstrap and Django and Rest APIs and hosted on nginx configuration on AWS EC2 instance , with integrating AWS RDS PostgreSQL database and AWS S3 as media storage.

[Covid-19 Global Tracker](https://www.covid.amannvl.me) using technologies like Django and Javascript and hosting the project on AWS EC2 instance.

[Tiktok Clone](http://tiktok.amannvl.me/) using technologies like React and Django and firebase hosting and firestore a firebase database.

[Movie Review Website](http://hashtagmovies.herokuapp.com/) built using technologies like Django and integrating different APIs with it like IMDB API and TMDB API , and hosted on HEROKU and using Heroku DB.



I was a back-end intern in an startup.There I learned a lot of things,I learned how to build RESTful APIs.Overall it was a nice experiance working on some real-time projects and contributing all those little codes I could make back then.
I am now a Python Django developer , though I am still learning new things while implementing them in few of my projects.
I've build some web apps using Django, they are "hashtagmovies.com" which can review any movie or series or event you search on it and "hashtagnews.com" which is basically a news website , I have also integrated the COVID-19 real updates on this website.
The best part about me is that if I'm into something then I usually break my own limits doing that thing to the fullest or until I found a solution for that problem.
I will not say that I know all the answers to your questions, but I know I'm good at finding the solutions.
